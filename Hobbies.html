  Outside of my professional life, I enjoy playing a variety of outdoor games,
  exploring new destinations, and immersing myself in different cultures through
  travel. Coding is a true passion of mine, and I find great satisfaction in
  bringing ideas to life through technology. Additionally, I love unwinding by
  watching movies, which fuels my creativity and provides fresh perspectives. I
  am enthusiastic about continuous learning and eager to contribute to exciting
  projects while balancing my diverse interests.
